Pystore is a web-based application for uploading, tagging, searching, and viewing documents. 
It is based on the Tornado web framework. 

To run Pystore:
1) Ensure that tornado is available in the python environment (pip install tornado)
2) Update options in the pystore.py file, including application name, domain name, and port.
There are also settings for outgoing email used for account creation and password resets.
If SSL is to be used, update the filenames of the certificate and key files. The files should be placed in the /certs directory.
3) Run the pystore.py script. (python pystore.py &)

When started for the first time, an admin account will be created with the username/password admin/admin. Obviously, this password should be changed ASAP.
Admin users can invite other users, and generate keys for password resets.
